Prototype of SleepGator.
croco-project

A croco project that we made in a small group.

We made a prototype of a SleepGator which helps you get rid of your phone at night or when you want to study. All you need to do is set up an alarm, put your phone in the mouth of SleepGator and press a button located in croco's lower jaw to close the jaws. When the alarm rings a microphone inside the prototype triggers and two electric motors open the jaws. Now you have access to your phone again that is also recharged. If you forget to set the alarm, or really need the phone, there is also second option to open the jaws: press the jaw button for tedious 10 seconds and it opens the jaws. That raises the threshold to open your phone on a whim.
